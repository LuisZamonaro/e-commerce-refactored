The project idea was taken from the FrontEndMentor website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). I refactored this project, aiming to improve my skills in context handling,
clean code, ReactRouterDom, and responsiveness.

To start this app, you need to open the integrated terminal in the "e-commerce-with-firebase" folder and type "npm run dev" or "yarn dev."
